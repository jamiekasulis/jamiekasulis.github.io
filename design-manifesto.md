# Design Manifesto
## Here is what I learned

Learning principles of design taught me many things. Before anything, it broke down the misconception that designers are just clever people with inexplicably genius vision. Over the course of the semester, I learned that there is both a science and an art to design, and that design choices are evidence-driven; research and experimentation undergirds the entire design process. 

### MY PROJECT: MUSEUMS FOR ALL
Describe my project here so I don't have to re-explain it again.

Here are five main takeaways from my semester studying human-computer interaction.**Above all else, design made me reckon with the fact that the things I create will have an impact on people, and it is both my professional and ethical imperative to think critically about what that impact will be.**

### COMMUNICATION IS KEY
This semester, I had to talk about my design process at least as much as I actually took part in it. Over and over again, I described and motivated my problem, explained how my team and I went about some aspect of the research, and demonstrated different parts of our design. Having to constantly re-explain these things actually helped me to better understand them. I learned the importance of motivating a problem, both to justify its investigation to outsiders but also to help myself zero in on what was important and what was at stake. For example, my group's initial [project proposal](https://museumsforall.github.io/project-proposal/) struggled to articulate what exactly we saw as the problem. Was the issue one of physical, intellectual, or social accessibility? By the time we completed our [final write-up](https://museumsforall.github.io/understanding-to-make/), we not only had zeroed in on a focus but were better at articulating what is at stake in our design:
* We are designing for people of color, for whom the literature shows that museums are often inaccessible
* Underlying the inaccessibility are issues such as representation, presentation, and power
* The inaccessibility manifests in negative emotions which diminish the person of color's experience in the museum
* We aim to intervene on this issue by designing an educational museum platform for learning and discussion regarding social issues that affect people of color, that people of color are talking about



### BE OPEN TO NEW IDEAS


### DON'T BE A PERFECTIONIST


### ACCESSIBILITY


### A PERSONAL CODE OF ETHICS
