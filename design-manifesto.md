title: Design Manifesto
---
Learning principles of design taught me many things. Before anything, it broke down the misconception that designers are just clever people with inexplicably genius vision. Over the course of the semester, I learned that there is both a science and an art to design, and that design choices are evidence-driven; research and experimentation undergirds the entire design process. 

Here are five main takeaways from my semester studying human-computer interaction. **Above all else, design made me reckon with the fact that the things I create will have an impact on people, and it is both my professional and ethical imperative to think critically about what that impact will be.**

### 1. COMMUNICATION IS KEY

**Honing my communication skills has enabled me to more concisely and intentionally explain what the problem is and how my design intervenes.**

This semester, I had to talk about my design process at least as much as I actually took part in it. Over and over again, I described and motivated my problem, explained how my team and I went about some aspect of the research, and demonstrated different parts of our design. Having to constantly re-explain these things actually helped me to better understand them. I learned the importance of motivating a problem, both to justify its investigation to outsiders but also to help myself zero in on what was important and what was at stake. For example, my group's initial [project proposal](https://museumsforall.github.io/project-proposal/) struggled to articulate what exactly we saw as the problem. Was the issue one of physical, intellectual, or social accessibility? Compare this to our [final write-up](https://museumsforall.github.io/understanding-to-make/), where we not only had zeroed in on a focus but were better at articulating what is at stake in our design.

In a nutshell: *We are designing for people of color, for whom the literature and our own research shows that museums are often inaccessible for. Underlying the inaccessibility are issues such as representation, presentation, and institutional power. The inaccessibility manifests in negative emotions which diminish the person of color's experience in the museum. We aim to intervene on this issue by designing an educational museum platform for learning and discussion regarding social issues that affect people of color, that people of color are talking about.*


### 2. BE OPEN TO NEW IDEAS

**Being open to new ideas allowed me to see the value in ideas that were not my own. It also pushed me to experiment with the different directions my design could go.**

Thinking more deeply about brainstorming was the first step in learning to have an open mind for design. While reading about brainstorming, it became clear to me that facilitating brainstorming sessions is a skill (Sutton), and one that I certainily have not developed much at all. That said, being primed on some brainstorming best practices-- such as to try to *build* off of teammates' ideas  wherever you can (Sutton)-- did help us build off of each other's creativity.

In the early days of our design process, we had to rapidly [sketch](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-12-task-sketches/) out design ideas for different forms, interactions, features, and tasks. This meant that, rather than dwelling on the idea of making a mobile app that does typical mobile app functions X, Y, and Z, I had to experiment with other ideas. We tossed around the idea of making an audio-based interface, for example, and so I had to consider the unique affordances of that medium whereas I might otherwise have disqualified it immediately if we hadn't done the sketches.


### 3. DON'T BE A PERFECTIONIST

**Trading slow, precise work for rapid, lo-fi, iterative design keeps the creativity flowing while also making sure your design is tried-and-true by the time it comes into its high-fidelity version.**

I have a tendency to be a perfectionist. I meticulously outline my papers before a word is ever written, use stencils to draw perfect circles in my math notes, and clean my room almost every day. So you can imagine that this lesson was particularly difficult to learn. 

When my group made our first [paper prototype](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-29-Paper-Prototype/), my teammates had to remind me that the task was meant to be quick and dirty. I reluctantly left my aforementioned stencils behind as a result. It turns out that the series of testing that followed making our first paper prototype and necessitated many changes to it proved that it was not worth it to sink so much time into "perfecting" an inherently riddled-with-flaws draft of our design.

I learned not to get bogged down in the details if it means stunting the development of your vision. Rapid, iterative testing is both more affordable than and more effective than slow, precise work. Furthermore, going too high-fidelity can result in less useful data during testing. As we read in "Prototyping for Tiny Fingers" by Marc Rettig, the issue with hi-fi is that "Reviewers and testers tend to comment on 'fit and finish' issues" (22) rather than the functionality or intuitiveness of your design.

When it came to making our higher-fidelity digital mockup, it actually happened really quickly. This is because we had already done several rounds of testing on the design while it was in paper form, and thus knew to include all of the necessary feedback, back buttons, help messages, and so on. It's quicker to do that with paper than it is to do with software like Balsamiq. I also had the added psychological benefit of feeling more confident in my design, which had survived a few rounds of testing already by the time it made it into its higher-fidelity version.

### 4. ACCESSIBILITY IS A MUST

**Accessibility is not a niche topic. It is my ethical and professional imperative to make my work as accessible as possible to folks with varying degrees of physical, mental, or emotional ability.**

It's easy to make assumptions about who will use your design and what their physical, mental, or emotional ability is. Taking some time to learn about the many things designers consider when working to make technology more accessible to the visually-impaired enlightened me about the use of screen readers and the very concrete things that we as computer scientists, software developers, blog writers, Facebook posters, twitter users-- virtually everyone, that is-- can do to help make the web more accessible. Then, I learned that there are many other dimensions of accessibility to consider.

Some of the many things I learned are:
* To think of folks with various forms of anxiety. Collecting some sort of input or response from users and then not giving them clear messaging on how that will be used or what they should expect in terms of next steps can be anxiety-inducing (Pun 8).
* To include clear, encompassing, descriptive captions whenever I use an image on social media so that folks using screen readers can tell what the image demonstrates. To also include these in ALT tags (Theofanos and Redish 13)
* To structure websites with clear headers, subheaders, and link names because folks who use screen readers scan with their ears (Theofanos and Redish 4)
* To consider what kinds of mobility a user may be capable of, and to thusly avoid check boxes, radio buttons, and other mechanics that require fine motor skills (Pun 6)

**Learning this, and much more, has informed my approach to accessibility in design:**
* Consider accessibility in terms of emotional, mental, AND physical ability.
* While fancy graphics and rhetorical flair might be tempting, carefully documented ALT tags, clear and descriptive headers, and simple language are ultimately more accessible. Prefer accessibility to unnecessary flair.
* When possible, accommodate less precise actions, provide shortcuts, and provide other formats (i.e. non-textual) for the information.
* Be clear with your users about how their input will be used and what they should expect from you.
* Dedicate yourself to continually learning more about accessibility and building on your accessible design/development skill set.


### 5. ETHICS IS EVERYTHING
It's important to me to preface my personal code of ethics by pointing out that I live in a society that supposedly values science, "hard facts," and rule of law. We might call this a *positivist* society, one that values objectivity, data, and numbers, a society that affords more social capital to engineers than it does to social workers, one that often sidesteps issues of morality under the names of "innovation" and "progress." 

I call upon the work of the inspirational Patricia Hill Collins, particularly her work on "Black Feminist Epistemology" (*Black Feminist Thought*, 2008), where she explains how a society that over-relies on positivism while invalidating other knowledge forms does a lot to perpetuate racism and other oppressions.

At a top-level, I identify some of the things that said over-reliance on positivism contributes to my society:
* A disregard and diminishment of the value of personal experience, subjectivity, and the existence of multiple truths
* A privileging of people who have access to the academy, STEM professions, and other elite positions, and an invalidation of those who do not
* An encouragement for people to disregard the moral implications of their actions in favor of "objective" or "neutral" analysis of situations

I point out these things because, as someone who will enter the workforce as some sort of software developer/engineer, I will reap to some degree the benefits of a positivist society-- and so I will also be implicated in the harm that it does. People will look at my profession with a certain amount of respect and take seriously my analysis if it is undergirded by certain kinds of analysis. I need to reckon with the epistemological oppression that I benefit from.

**And so, my personal code of ethics is as follows:**
* Always validate other knowledge forms. Acknowledge the privilege of my profession/education.
* Always consider the ethical implications of my work. I am never excused from responsibility.
* Accessibility is not a niche subject-- it is both an ethical and professional imperative.
* Take safety seriously, and honor that through rigorous testing and consultation. Even the Titanic sunk!
* When seeking user participation, be transparent about my motives and *clearly and visibly* communicate how information will be used and how privacy will be respected.
* Hold myself accountable for mistakes. Be transparent when I make them, and then learn from them.
