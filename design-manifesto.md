title: Design Manifesto
---
Learning principles of design taught me many things. Before anything, it broke down the misconception that designers are just clever people with inexplicably genius vision. Over the course of the semester, I learned that there is both a science and an art to design, and that design choices are evidence-driven; research and experimentation undergirds the entire design process. 

### MY PROJECT: MUSEUMS FOR ALL
Describe my project here so I don't have to re-explain it again.

Here are five main takeaways from my semester studying human-computer interaction.**Above all else, design made me reckon with the fact that the things I create will have an impact on people, and it is both my professional and ethical imperative to think critically about what that impact will be.**

### 1. COMMUNICATION IS KEY
This semester, I had to talk about my design process at least as much as I actually took part in it. Over and over again, I described and motivated my problem, explained how my team and I went about some aspect of the research, and demonstrated different parts of our design. Having to constantly re-explain these things actually helped me to better understand them. I learned the importance of motivating a problem, both to justify its investigation to outsiders but also to help myself zero in on what was important and what was at stake. For example, my group's initial [project proposal](https://museumsforall.github.io/project-proposal/) struggled to articulate what exactly we saw as the problem. Was the issue one of physical, intellectual, or social accessibility? Compare this to our [final write-up](https://museumsforall.github.io/understanding-to-make/), where we not only had zeroed in on a focus but were better at articulating what is at stake in our design.

In a nutshell: *We are designing for people of color, for whom the literature and our own research shows that museums are often inaccessible for. Underlying the inaccessibility are issues such as representation, presentation, and institutional power. The inaccessibility manifests in negative emotions which diminish the person of color's experience in the museum. We aim to intervene on this issue by designing an educational museum platform for learning and discussion regarding social issues that affect people of color, that people of color are talking about.*

**Honing my communication skills has enabled me to more concisely and intentionally explain what the problem is and how my design intervenes.**


### 2. BE OPEN TO NEW IDEAS
Thinking more deeply about brainstorming was the first step in learning to have an open mind for design. While reading about brainstorming, it became clear to me that facilitating brainstorming sessions is a skill (Sutton), and one that I certainily have not developed much at all. That said, being primed on some brainstorming best practices-- such as to try to *build* off of teammates' ideas  wherever you can (Sutton)-- did help me both respect and work with the creativity that all of us brought to the team.

In the early days of our design process, we had to rapidly [sketch](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-12-task-sketches/) out design ideas for different forms, interactions, features, and tasks. This meant that, rather than dwelling on the idea of making a mobile app that does typical mobile app functions X, Y, and Z, I had to experiment with other ideas. We tossed around the idea of making an audio-based interface, for example, and so I had to consider the unique affordances of that medium whereas I might otherwise have disqualified it immediately if we hadn't done the sketches.

**Being open to new ideas allowed pushed me to see the value in ideas that were not my own. It also pushed me to experiment with the different directions my design could take.**


### 3. DON'T BE A PERFECTIONIST
I have a tendency to be a perfectionist. I meticulously outline my papers before a word is ever written, use stencils to draw perfect circles in my math notes, and clean my room almost every day. So you can imagine that this lesson was particularly difficult to learn. But even more than the last two lessons, I learned the value of rapid, lo-fi, iterative prototyping.

When my group made our first [paper prototype](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-29-Paper-Prototype/), my teammates had to remind me that the task was meant to be quick and dirty. I reluctantly left my aforementioned stencils behind as a result. It turns out that the series of testing that followed making our first paper prototype and necessitated many changes to it proved that it was not worth it to sink so much time into "perfecting" an inherently riddled-with-flaws draft of our design.

I learned not to get bogged down in the details if it means stunting the development of your vision. Rapid, iterative testing is both more affordable than and more effective than slow, precise work. Furthermore, going too high-fidelity can result in less useful data during testing. As we read in "Prototyping for Tiny Fingers" by Marc Rettig, the issue with hi-fi is that "Reviewers and testers tend to comment on 'fit and finish' issues" (22) rather than the functionality or intuitiveness of your design.

When it came to making our higher-fidelity digital mockup, it actually happened really uickly. This is because we had already done several rounds of testing on the design while it was in paper form, and thus knew to include all of the necessary feedback, back buttons, help messages, and so on. It's quicker to do that with paper than it is to do with software like Balsamiq. I also had the added psychological benefit of feeling more confident in my design, which had survived a few rounds of testing already by the time it made it into its higher-fidelity version.

**Trading slow, precise work for rapid, lo-fi, iterative design keeps the creativity flowing while also making sure your design is tried-and-true by the time it comes into its high-fidelity version.**
