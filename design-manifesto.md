title: Design Manifesto
---
Learning principles of design taught me many things. Before anything, it broke down the misconception that designers are just clever people with inexplicably genius vision. Over the course of the semester, I learned that there is both a science and an art to design, and that design choices are evidence-driven; research and experimentation undergirds the entire design process. 

### MY PROJECT: MUSEUMS FOR ALL
Describe my project here so I don't have to re-explain it again.

Here are five main takeaways from my semester studying human-computer interaction.**Above all else, design made me reckon with the fact that the things I create will have an impact on people, and it is both my professional and ethical imperative to think critically about what that impact will be.**

### 1. COMMUNICATION IS KEY
This semester, I had to talk about my design process at least as much as I actually took part in it. Over and over again, I described and motivated my problem, explained how my team and I went about some aspect of the research, and demonstrated different parts of our design. Having to constantly re-explain these things actually helped me to better understand them. I learned the importance of motivating a problem, both to justify its investigation to outsiders but also to help myself zero in on what was important and what was at stake. For example, my group's initial [project proposal](https://museumsforall.github.io/project-proposal/) struggled to articulate what exactly we saw as the problem. Was the issue one of physical, intellectual, or social accessibility? Compare this to our [final write-up](https://museumsforall.github.io/understanding-to-make/), where we not only had zeroed in on a focus but were better at articulating what is at stake in our design.

In a nutshell: *We are designing for people of color, for whom the literature and our own research shows that museums are often inaccessible for. Underlying the inaccessibility are issues such as representation, presentation, and institutional power. The inaccessibility manifests in negative emotions which diminish the person of color's experience in the museum. We aim to intervene on this issue by designing an educational museum platform for learning and discussion regarding social issues that affect people of color, that people of color are talking about.*

Honing my communication skills has enabled me to more concisely and intentionally explain what the problem is and how my design intervenes.


### 2. BE OPEN TO NEW IDEAS
Thinking more deeply about brainstorming was the first step in learning to have an open mind for design. While reading about brainstorming, it became clear to me that facilitating brainstorming sessions is a skill (Sutton), and one that I certainily have not developed much at all. That said, being primed on some brainstorming best practices-- such as to try to *build* off of teammates' ideas  wherever you can (Sutton)-- did help me both respect and work with the creativity that all of us brought to the team.

In the early days of our design process, we had to rapidly [sketch](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-12-task-sketches/) out design ideas for different forms, interactions, features, and tasks. This meant that, rather than dwelling on the idea of making a mobile app that does typical mobile app functions X, Y, and Z, I had to experiment with other ideas. We tossed around the idea of making an audio-based interface, for example, and so I had to consider the unique affordances of that medium whereas I might otherwise have disqualified it immediately if we hadn't done the sketches.

Being open to new ideas allowed pushed me to see the value in ideas that were not my own. It also pushed me to experiment with the different directions my design could take.


### 3. DON'T BE A PERFECTIONIST


### 4. ACCESSIBILITY


### 5. A PERSONAL CODE OF ETHICS
