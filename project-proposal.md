### The Problem
When you go to the park, you can expect to walk around, play frisbee, or sit down on a bench. You can interact physically with 
the space of the park in many different ways. If you do an escape room, you can expect to pick up objects, dig around the room 
for clues, and engage your problem-solving skills to win.

Interacting with a museum can sometimes be rather two-dimensional: you walk, you look, you meander along a predictable path. 
I've often thought that it's hard to be in a museum if you're "not in the mood," that is, if you aren't feeling deeply focused and 
if you aren't prepared to spend hours walking and looking on in an almost tense silence, touching nothing, moving slowly, etc.
In this way, I feel that museums can discourage engagement and over-value a studious silence. They enforce a 
sort of passive observation that can be just as draining as it can be intellectually engaging.

So my question is, how do we 
add dimension to the experience of being a museum visitor? How can we allow people to take action? How can we give visitors a 
sense of agency that goes beyond choosing a walking route through the museum? How do we make space for feelings of discovery, 
agency, and creativity? How do we use our bodies to make a trip to the museum to become an interactive, material, 
physical experience-- allowing us to complement the materiality invoked by the works and heighten our overall experience?

### Going Deeper
I want to somehow add dimension to the way that people interact with museums and artwork. What if museums gave us ample 
opportunity to be participants rather than viewers, to take action rather than observe passively*? What if museums could 
provide some kind of tactile experience? As 
is, museums (and artists) are already doing a lot to add dimension to our experiences. Artists add auditory dimension to 
their works, which museums facilitate with speaker installations. Museums occasionally let you touch things or provide 
playrooms and creativity labs for you to get hands-on. People have also created scavenger hunts and guided 
tours to encourage interaction with exhibits. WCMA also invites viewers to participate insofar as joining the conversation 
around its pieces, inviting the public to the act of interpretation and meaning-making. All of these ideas are inspirational. 
But I want to push the idea of multidimensionality further. I want to include some kind of physical opportunity for visitors 
in the way they move through the museum. I am interested in what we can design to disrupt the *walk-look-meander pattern.

* I reiterate, as an avid museum fan, that even engaging deeply with a work often requires a distant, hands-off observation. 
This is what I mean when I say "passive."
