#### “Contesting the City: Enacting the Political Through Digitally Supported Urban Walks” by Clara Crivallero, Rob Comber, Martyn Dade-Robertson, Simon Bowen, Peter Wright, Patrick Olivier

I read “Contesting the City: Enacting the Political Through Digitally Supported Urban Walks” by Crivellaro et. al, written in membership with the Culture Lab of the School of Computing Science as well as the School of Architecture Planning and Landscape at Newcastle University. The paper described the political space of HCI and the current state of how experts go about designing for civic and political engagement with justice-oriented agendas. They described a method they pioneered called the City Walk, which is a designed walking experience through a city that promotes political engagement with the city space, opens up discussion about institutional power structures and how they manifest in daily life, and utilizes the everyday and lived experiences of the participants. The authors present their methodology as a design pattern with specific principles: everyday language; the presence of multiple diverging perspectives; the use of political artifacts as food for discussion; the use of discussion prompts to help people begin to form connections; and the fostering of collectivity/group communication.

I was pretty convinced by the paper that these main principles are important to fostering political engagement among the participants. For example, the discussion prompts combined with what they call a political archive seemed like a good way to promote discussion and make opportunities for people to share their thoughts, learn from others’ thoughts, and start to see things in a new way. It also made sense to me how the prioritization of everyday language and activities (such as walking) would help engage people: there is no exclusion via academic language, a lack of theoretical background, etc. Admittedly, walking might be an exclusive activity, though.
  
After reading this paper, I really wish we had made our design more participatory and more educational. For example, I really liked how the City Walks method provided the participants with a “counterfactual map” (Crivellaro 2), which is a piece of content pre-generated by the designers that was meant to be contradictory to the actual city map and thus thought-provoking. This seemed like a very interesting tool to use to engage users. Our design in general does not conceptualize that much pre-generated content, but I think we could have used some of that creativity on our own to come up with something that would make for a more compelling experience for users. Secondly, the City Walks method is participatory in many ways. There’s the intellectual act of interpreting the counterfactual map as well as the social act of negotiating the route you will take through it, and sharing your thoughts at each location. Our design limits participation to the simple forms of reading content and submitting discussion points-- which, I admit, is not nearly as exciting. I think our project could benefit a lot from adopting some of the principles described in this paper. I don’t think there’s anything that we are doing better than what is described in this paper.
