## A Bad Design at Williams College:
### The EMS Room Scheduler

The EMS Room Scheduler is the website Williams students are supposed to use to reserve classroom spaces for their clubs. Initially, I was overwhlemed by it-- the first thing you see after logging in is a verbose page of instructions and warnings with mismatched formatting:

There is a navigation bar at the top, which is a pretty standard way of letting people make their way through your site. But the labels are a bit vague; for example, it isn't clear what the difference between "Browse Facilities" and "Browse for Space" would be if you're just trying to schedule a room for your club meeting (which is 99% of what people are probably using this website for).

A third thing: you can select any available features you would like for your space, such as having a laptop HDMI hook-up, which is very nice. But not all students are going to necessarily know what some of these features are. For example, what's the functional difference between "HD Projection," a "transparency projector," and "Projection/Flat Screen?"

**Please also note:** Why can you search for rooms that are *not* handicap accessible... and yet, at a notoriously inaccessible school like Williams, you can't search for rooms that *are* handicap accessible.
