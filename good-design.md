I work in Schow Science Library, and I am appreciative of its main doors. There are a few qualities that I think are nice:
- The doors are light and easy to open. Very helpful when you're carrying three textbooks, a laptop charger you're about to drop, and your third coffee of the day. In other words, the door is no obstacle.
- It is very clear whether the doors are meant to be pushed or pulled, and this is accomplished without "Push" and "Pull" signifiers. You can tell by the doorknobs, absence of doorknobs, and push bars.

- Multiple doors side-by-side accommodates more traffic. This is also aided by the fact that there is an even number of doors, implicitly demarcating a *left* and *right* side which helps people choose which door to go through in a split second according to whether they are entering or exiting the library.

But there are also things I think could be better:
- **Where is the automatic door button?** This is a necessary accommodation, and it is not immediately apparent. (Edit: I cannot find one anywhere.)
- The four metal book strip detectors can be an obstruction when you are trying to carry wide items into the library, as I have witnessed multiple times from behind the desk.
- The four identical metal book strip detectors side-by-side makes me wonder if we might be able to have one large one instead.
